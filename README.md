This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
Initially this project was a RESTful API I made by following the instructions on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjf774RKrLc).

### Built With

* [materialize-css](https://materializecss.com/)


## Available Scripts

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Start MongoDB and make a MongoDB Database. More information at ["https://www.mongodb.com/basics/create-database"]
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/axb157030/NodeJS_RESTful.git --recurse-submodules
```
3. Install NPM packages. Make sure to install them in the react-client-test directory as well
```sh
npm install
```
4. Install `materialize-css`
```sh
npm install materialize-css
```

5. Replace DB_CONNECTION in app.js directory inside the project directory with the the uri needed to connect to MongoDB. Example ['mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp']

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
